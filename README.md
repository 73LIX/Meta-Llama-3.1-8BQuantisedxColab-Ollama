# Meta-Llama-3.1-8BQuantisedxColab-Ollama

Meta Llama 3.1 is the latest open source LLM released by meta. It supports 8 Languages `English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai`. Here you can run the model for free in Quantized form provided by `Ollama` on the `T4 Gpu` of google colab.

The **Quantized**ðŸŽ¯ form is basically smaller in size then the original model, which saves your disk space, internet and also has faster inferences.

NOTE: This colab notebook performs better than the Llama 3.1-8B_Colab notebook, in terms of inference speed and model size. And you are free from that hugging face access and token hassle.
